Thanks @!!#$b#
You've proven yer worth to this town.#$b#
I'll remove the cursed bones that blocked the entrance to the Old Mines.#$b#
To show my gratitude, here is 200 Durbloons.#$b#
Durbloons are the currency here in Durin's Rest.#$b#
Head into the mine and break some of the rather strange, wood-like, carbon composite Durinium Crystals to reveal the Durinium within.#$b#
Among many other uses, Durinium can be crafted into Durbloons and used to purchase goods here in my sleepy town of Rest.#$b#
Come back to my wee little shop and purchase the recipe to make Durbloons from me for Durinium once ya have acquired some.#$b#
You've intrigued me... I am a pacifist but I respect a great warrior, and I know one when I see one.#$b#
Prove to me ya have what it takes and I'll bestow upon ye the title of 'Shadows Bane' and place my family heirloom, a mighty hammer, in yer hands.#$b#
First ya must head into the Old Mines and slay the undead miners that have been trapped in there since I sealed it shut decades ago...#$b#
Good luck! I know ya can do it!",
