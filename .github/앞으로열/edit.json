The one who pulls this sword from stone will be crowned ki... well not quite king but you'll certainly have an easier time in the mines...

It reads: 
'Here lies Durin. First of his name. Slayer of darkness and bane of shadows.' This must be who the town was named after!
'Here lies Durin Shadowbane The Second. Slayer of hearts and bane of fair maidens.' I wonder who's heart he broke...?
Here lies Durin Shadowbane The Third. Hero of The Elemental Wars.' I bet the term 'Hero' would seem subjective to the Shadow People...
Here lies 'Durin Shadowbane' The Fourth. It looks like the titles have yet to be filled in, this must be where our current Durin is due to be burried...
It's too old and worn out to be able to make out what it says...
There's a... totem? In here? I swear nobody was in here... How did this totem get inside this book? Well, they said you'd know how to use it...
Good luck on your journey! If you find anything worthy of a museum out there be sure to bring it back here!
